# Farmageddon
Farmageddon is a 2D side scroller game built upon the Unity Engine,
where you play as a tough-as-nails farmer standing alone against invading hordes of menacing animals. Charging wild hogs, menacing crocodiles, laughing hyenas, and cunning coyotes are after your crops of corn, wheat and pumpkins. Use your trusty arsenal of firearms, grenades and BALLISTIC MISSILES to fend off the animal invaders - toss hogs, mince hyenas, and blow crocodiles to bits - to protect your farm from total destruction. But beware, the more animals you "Detain", the bigger, meaner, and faster they become. Can you defend your fields long enough to bring in a bountiful harvest, or will the slavering hyenas, charging hogs, and fearless crocodiles finally succeed in total farm devastation? Grab your farmer's hat, avoid cow patties, and get ready for some hilarious 2D side scrolling farming action filled with bullet spewing, crop dodging, and explosive animal blasting mayhem in Farmageddon!
